		<h2>Completely distributed design</h2>
		<p>
		We've designed Buddycloud so that anyone can run their own buddycloud server.
		This means that companies and privacy aware individuals can maintain their own
		communication cloud behind the firewall and selectively choose what data they
		wish to share with others.
		</p>
		<p>
		The old way of building communication services was to put all the data into
		a central core.
		</p>
		<p>
		Buddycloud is a revolutionary new design where anyone can run their own
		Buddycloud server, and each buddycloud server will find, connect and share the
		data you choose with users on other Buddycloud servers.
		</p>
		<p>
		This approach has huge benefits, especially for industries that care about
		data privacy (Finance, Medicine).

		<h2>Scalable</h2>
		<p>
		Scaling your service because it's popular is a 'good problem to have'.
		And it needs a good roadmap: so we have designed Buddycloud to grow with you
		and scale up without bottlenecks. Buddycloud is currently tested against servers
		that scale to over 10M simultaneous users. Additionally, each server can
		subsequently be scaled horizontally to support more simultaneous users.
		</p>
		<p>
		Buddycloud also works with commercial realtime CDNs like fanout.io which help you
		offload capacity to a Global push CDN.
		</p>
		<h2>Rich Communications</h2>
		<p>
		Move beyond just text sharing: Buddycloud enables you to share media files
		with just one channel or with the entire world. And to make development easy, the
		Buddycloud API will return scaled thumbnails for easy embedded into your application.
		</p>
		<p>
		Our rich communication roadmap includes adding full webRTC video calling between Buddycloud channels.
		</p>
		<h2>By developers, for developers</h2>
		<p>
		Buddycloud is designed make adding communication to web and app development as simple as possible by
		offloading as much of the tricky application logic to the server. This means you can quickly write
		reliable, services by just using the existing Buddycloud libraries.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Buddycloud platform follows a convention over configuration approach that helps you
		quickly build without pre-configuration.  {action} view the API {action}
		</p>
		<h2>Open source and open standards</h2>
		<p>
		Secure communication needs open, inspectable secure communications come from publishing
		code as open source. Buddycloud's code is maintained on Github and released under
		the Apache 2.0 license. Buddycloud builds on existing standards like ActivityStrea.ms
		and the ATOM syndication format: you benefit from being able to reuse
		a wide range of existing libraries.
		</p>
		<p>
		Buddycloud works closely with the W3C, Mozilla Foundation, and XSF to build
		the strong foundation for an open communication ecosystem.
		</p>
		<h2>Secure by design.</h2>
		<p>
		Buddycloud is used by security-sensitive agencies to protoct their communications.
		</p>
		Buddycloud's modular design means that components communicate in their own security space and leverage the tested XMPP communication security for inter-module communication.</p>
		<p>All code is peer-reviewed and extensively tested.</p>
		<p>All communication between buddycloud servers and clients uses TLSv1.2 for encryption.</p>
		<p>Buddycloud uses hashed passwords</p>
		<h2>User privacy</h2>
		<p>
		Buddycloud enables users to set different privacy settings per channel.
		Administrators can set permissions per Buddycloud site. Users can select who can
		view their channel, make it open to just other members of their
		Buddycloud site, or open to the world.
		</p>
		<h2>Run it yourself or have Buddycloud host it for you.</h2>
		<p>
		Buddycloud comes in two compatible flavours: fully hosted and an install-it-yourself
		set of packages and instructions. Both editions use exactly the same code so that you have the
		flexibility to migrate your data and users between platforms by just changing the API url.
		</p>
		<p>
		We recommend you test drive Buddycloud using the existing public API on the hosted service
		before spinning up your own install. Then when you are ready, follow
		the Install Guide or Sign up for professional hosting.
		</p>
		<h2>Community and enterprise editions</h2>
		<p>
		The Buddycloud community edition is open source, free to download and run on your site.
		It aims to provide the best both worlds: rapid updates and fixes with
		long-term stability, supportability, and maintainability.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Buddycloud enterprise edition is integrated, tested, and Includes patches, updates,
		SLA-based support, multi-year maintenance policies.
		</p>
		<p>
		Get in touch to find our more which edition is best for your needs.
		</p>
		<h2>Extensible design</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Structured data {link to architecture page}</li>
			<li>Application nodes within a channel</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>We have working demos</h2>
		<p>
		{lots of screenshots}
		</p>
		<h2>Modular</h2>
		<p>
		Keep your operations lean and mean by only running the Buddycloud services you need.
		If you don't need to support media or push notifications, it's as simple
		as not installing these services. If you find out that you later need
		social recommendations, just add that Buddycloud component.
		</p>
		<h2>{link to quick start}</h2>
		<h2>Easy to use</h2>
		<p>
		As a general rule we don't want to invent an enormous system that takes ages to master.
		Buddycloud should be as easy to use as reading the API and getting data from endpoints
		like <code>api.example.com/testuser@myapp.com/content/posts</code>.
		</p>
		<h2>Lots of libraries</h2>
		<p>
		buddycloud.js, xmpp-ftw or the android SDK
		</p>
		<p>
		"As a general rule we don't want to invent an enormous java.beans.everything class that
		people have to inherit from. Instead we'd like the JavaBeans runtimes to provide default
		behaviour for 'normal' objects, but to allow objects to override a given piece of default
		behaviour by inheriting from some specific java.beans.something interface."
		</p>
		<h2>push notifications</h2>
		<ul>	
			<li>email or mobile</li>
			<li>compatible with gateways like mailgun or sendgrid</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Scale Buddycloud to millions of users</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>scalable architecture</li>
			<li>scale horizontally</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>share media (unlke other services - media can be open or closed)</h2>
		<h2>open, open, open</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>open protocol</li>
			<li>open open code</li>
			<li>open design process</li>
			<li>community</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>secure</h2>
		<h2>features to get you started</h2>
		<p>
		Together with services like push notifications we've added a host of useful modules
		that will get you started. The media server enables sharing of small and large files
		in channels, the search engine indexes public channels.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the firehose presents a realtime feed of new content</li>
			<li>friend finder</li>
			<li>channel discovery (active channels, recommended channels)</li>
			<li>media server</li>
			<li>search engine</li>
			<li>firehose</li>
			<li>APIs and SDKs</li>
